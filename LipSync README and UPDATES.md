# LipSync-Project
An assistive technology project which enables quadriplegics the ability to use smartphones and other mobile devices through the use of a mouth-controlled joystick with integrated sip and puff functionality

This GitHub repository will serve as a database for STL, STEP, IGES, Gerber, SCH, BRD, INO and all other files associated with the LipSync project.

There are three main branches of the LipSync repository:

Mechanical: solid model and 3-d printing files including STL, STP/STEP, IGES and SolidWorks files. This will also include the mechanical parts list and assembly instructions.

Electronics and Software: Eagle schematics and board layouts in .BRD, .SCH and .PDF formats. This will also include the electronics part list and assembly instructions (one document .DOCX and .PDF). And finally the Arduino Micro microcontroller code in the .INO file format.

Mounting Options: 3-d printable clamps and mountings will be deposited here as well as commerically available solutions. This directory is not currently being maintained by one of our team so updates will not be very regular.

If there are any questions (preferably not criticisms) about the electrical or mechanical aspects of the project feel free to email me ivang@neilsquire.ca and I can direct your questions to the correct team member.
