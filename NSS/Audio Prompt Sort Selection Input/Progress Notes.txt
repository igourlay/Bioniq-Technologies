Constructed prototype for audio prompt sip and puff input device (Jarrod)
 - Current: Prototyping PCB with microcontroller, audio synthesizer and S&P module installed on headers
 - Need to do: 1. connect appropriate I/O between microcontroller, audio syn and S&P module for proof of concept
	       2. write firmware for simple audio prompt sorting and S&P prompt selection
	       3. write firmware to output ASCII characters with the HID keyboard
